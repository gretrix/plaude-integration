# Kiro Setup Complete ✅

## What I've Done

I've analyzed your entire Plaud Integration project and set up Kiro with comprehensive steering rules and documentation.

## Project Understanding

Your project is a **Voice Transcript Processing & Personal Management System** that:
- Captures voice transcripts from Plaud app
- Uses Zapier + AI to extract structured data (diet tracking, task management, CRM)
- Processes data through a Flask Python webhook server
- Stores everything in MySQL database
- Provides a mobile-responsive web dashboard

**Current Status**: ✅ Production Ready and deployed on EC2

## What Information Is Needed for Specs?

Based on my analysis, your project is **feature-complete** for its current scope. However, if you want to create specs for future enhancements, here's what would be needed:

### Potential Spec Topics

#### 1. API Authentication System
**What's needed**:
- Authentication method preference (API keys, OAuth, JWT)
- User management requirements
- Permission levels needed
- Rate limiting requirements

#### 2. Data Export Feature
**What's needed**:
- Export formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF)
- What data to export (all tables or selective)
- Filtering/date range options
- Scheduling (manual vs automated)

#### 3. Analytics Dashboard
**What's needed**:
- What metrics to track (calorie trends, task completion rates, etc.)
- Chart types preferred (line, bar, pie)
- Time ranges (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Comparison features needed

#### 4. User Authentication for Web Dashboard
**What's needed**:
- Single user or multi-user
- Registration process
- Password reset flow
- Session management preferences

#### 5. Email Notifications
**What's needed**:
- What triggers notifications (task due dates, daily summaries)
- Email service preference (SendGrid, AWS SES, SMTP)
- Notification frequency
- Customization options

#### 6. Mobile App
**What's needed**:
- Platform priority (iOS, Android, or both)
- Native vs React Native vs Flutter
- Core features needed
- Offline functionality requirements

## How Kiro Will Help You Now

With these steering files in place, Kiro will:

1. **Understand your architecture** when making code changes
2. **Follow your coding standards** automatically
3. **Know your deployment process** for production updates
4. **Understand Zapier integration** when debugging or enhancing
5. **Reference your database schema** when writing queries
6. **Apply security best practices** to all code
7. **Maintain consistency** across the codebase

## Next Steps

### If You Want to Create a Spec

Just tell me what feature you want to build, for example:
- "Create a spec for adding API authentication"
- "Create a spec for data export functionality"
- "Create a spec for an analytics dashboard"

I'll guide you through the spec creation workflow:
1. **Requirements** - Define what you need
2. **Design** - Plan the architecture
3. **Tasks** - Break down implementation steps

### If You Want to Make Changes

Just ask me to:
- "Add a new API endpoint for X"
- "Fix the bug in Y"
- "Update the dashboard to show Z"

I'll use the steering rules to maintain consistency with your existing code.

### If You Have Questions

Ask me anything about:
- How your current system works
- How to deploy changes
- How to configure Zapier
- How to add new features
- How to troubleshoot issues
